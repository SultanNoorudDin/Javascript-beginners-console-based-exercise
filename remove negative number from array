const array = [1,2,3,-4,-5,23,4];
      array.sort(function(a,b) {
         return b - a;
      });
      let x = array.length
      for (x; x--;) {
         if ( array[x] < 0 ){
            array.pop();
         }
      }
console.log(array)

//i want to admit that this code is mine except that sort function. im still trying to understand how that worked. if anyone knows it pls make a txt explaining it and request to commit it
